# Simple-Website-Project
This is a simple website created with HTML5. It contains my "favorite book" and it was written with different types of tags e.g Form tags, Iframe tags, Horizontal tags.

The first segment of the code is the Header Segment which describes and introduces the webpage i.e the name of the book and the name of the writer.

The second segment is the Main Segment which describes the body(Main Content) of the website i.e the whole story in different paragraphs.

The last segment is the Footer Segment which is programmed to collect readers' information/comments about the article.

Here are the links to the picture of the website
